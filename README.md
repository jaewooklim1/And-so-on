## About

**And-so-on** is a full-stack web clone of the popular website, Amazon. Without a theme to go on, the purpose of **And-so-on** is to implement all that I have learned in App Academy and to flesh out a full website starting from scratch. By using data stored in PostgreSQL and from seeds, the website displays products in cards that are randomly generated each time the webpage is loaded. In addition, once the individual products pages are created, users will then be able to interact with whatever products they own when they are signed in.

Using technology such as 
1. **React**
2. **Redux**
3. **Ruby on Rails**
4. **Heroku**
5. **Amazon AWS S3**

the web application is dyanmic and changes are easily seen as well as manipulated.

### Features

* **User Auth**

* Users can sign up with their email, a username, and password/password confirmation on And-so-on. The database then salts their password and adds it to the database. 
* A demo account which automatically signs you in is also available for those that don't want to share their email, username preference or password combination.

* **Products Page**

All items are rendered when you first go onto the homepage. Separated into cards, the items are randomly generated each time you go onto the website.

**Example 1:**
